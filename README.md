# homedash
dash in flask development of a personal home dashboard

The things I want to show are mostly web pages.
Some are simple urls requiring regular update.
Some are webcam images requiring some cache finessing chicanery and regular refresh
including the north bondi rsl and bergs cams.

Includes work on some sensors attached my xiaomi aqara gateway based on https://github.com/Danielhiversen/PyXiaomiGateway
